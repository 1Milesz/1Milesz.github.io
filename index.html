                            <div>This year, we are taking a more frugal approach to our design. Instead of buying loads of new parts, we are making do with what we already have. The only new parts we buy are critical replacements to outdated components or unique parts, such as the worm gear, that we never had in the first place. This approach allows us to save money in our budget to afford better robots for our outreach initiative with ForKids. We have been using Lego Mindstorm EV3s, and since this generation has been out since 2013, we believe it is time for an upgrade.</div>

                    <p>Since 2023, our summers have been devoted to our volunteering initiative with ForKids. Over the course of 6 weeks, we spend 2 hours every Wednesday with children that are homeless or are from low-income backgrounds. During this time, we don't try to teach the kids all of the minute details of robotics, but rather cater to them an introductory experience so that they can figure out if robotics is truly interesting. Our usage of Lego Mindstorm EV3's shaped a straightforward learning environment, and it was easy for the kids to pick up. Many of our team's alumni even come back to contribute to this initiative.</p>
